                    <h6><b>10. Arbitration Provision</b></h6>
                    <p>
                        <b>A.</b> This Agreement is intended to outline a dispute resolution in two parts. (1) All claims and disputes must first
                        be attempted to be resolved through informal negotiation with Student Sublease representatives. (2) All claims and disputes
                        that cannot then be resolved shall require arbitration of every claim or dispute that lawfully can be arbitrated, except
                        for those claims and disputes which by the terms of this Agreement are expressly excluded from its provisions. This Arbitration
                        Provision is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”) and evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. This Arbitration Provision applies to any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or termination of the Agreement and survives after the Agreement terminates. Nothing contained in this Arbitration Provision shall be construed to prevent or excuse you from utilizing any informal procedure for resolution of complaints established in this Agreement (if any), and this Arbitration Provision is not intended to be a substitute for the utilization of such procedures.
                        Except as provided below, arbitration does not limit or affect the legal claims you may bring against the Company.
                        Agreeing to arbitration only affects where any such claims may be brought and how they will be resolved. Arbitration is a
                        process of private dispute resolution that does not involve the civil courts, a civil judge, or a jury. Instead, the
                        parties’ dispute is decided by a private arbitrator selected by the parties using the process set forth herein. Other
                        arbitration rules and procedures are also set forth herein. Unless the law requires otherwise, as determined by the
                        Arbitrator based upon the circumstances presented, you will be required to split the cost of any arbitration with the
                        Company.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>B. Except as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Provision is intended to apply to the resolution of disputes that
                            otherwise would be resolved in a court of law or before any forum other than arbitration, with the exception of
                            proceedings that must be exhausted under applicable law before pursuing a claim in a court of law or in any forum
                            other than arbitration. Except as it otherwise provides, this Arbitration Provision requires all such disputes to be
                            resolved only by an arbitrator through final and binding arbitration on an individual basis only and not by way of
                            court or jury trial, or by way of class, collective, or representative action.

                        arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this Arbitration Provision, including the enforceability,
                        revocability or validity of the Arbitration Provision or any portion of the Arbitration Provision. All such matters shall
                        be decided by an Arbitrator and not by a court or judge. However, as set forth below, the preceding sentences shall not
                        apply to disputes relating to the interpretation or application of the Class Action Waiver below, including their
                        enforceability, revocability or validity.

                        affiliates, subsidiaries, parents, and all successors and assigns of any of them, including but not limited to any disputes

                        rest periods, expense reimbursement, termination, harassment and claims arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civil

                        Regardless of any other terms of this Agreement, nothing prevents you from making a report to or filing a claim or charge
                        with any government agency, and nothing in this Agreement or Arbitration Provision prevents the investigation by a

                        Arbitration Provision shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency
                        in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration;

                        <br>
                        <b>G.</b> Selection of Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of you and the Company. Unless you
                        and the Company mutually agree otherwise, the Arbitrator shall be an attorney licensed to practice in the location where
                        the arbitration proceeding will be conducted, or a retired federal or state judicial officer who presided in the jurisdiction
                        where the arbitration will be conducted. If the Parties cannot agree on an Arbitrator, then an arbitrator will be selected
                        using the alternate strike method from a list of five (5) neutral arbitrators provided by JAMS (Judicial Arbitration &
                        Mediation Services). You will have the option of making the first strike. If a JAMS arbitrator is used, then the JAMS
                        Streamlined Arbitration Rules & Procedures rules will apply; however, if there is a conflict between the JAMS Rules and
                        this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern. Those rules are available at <b style="color: #33b5e5;">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</b>.

                        <br>
                        <b>H.</b> All claims in arbitration are subject to the same statutes of limitation that would apply in court. The party
                        bringing the claim must demand arbitration in writing and deliver the written demand by hand or first class mail to the
                        other party within the applicable statute of limitations period. The demand for arbitration shall include identification of
                        the Parties, a statement of the legal and factual basis of the claim(s), and a specification of the remedy sought. Any
                        demand for arbitration made to the Company shall be provided to Student Sublease, LLC c/o, 159 5th Street Northwest, Atlanta,
                        GA 30313. The arbitrator shall resolve all disputes regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration.
                        A party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an
                        arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground that the award to which that party may be entitled may be rendered
                        ineffectual without such provisional relief.

                        bring dispositive motions, and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any
                        disputes in this regard shall be resolved by the Arbitrator. <b>You and the Company agree to resolve any dispute that is in
                        arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class, collective action, or representative basis
                        (“Class Action Waiver”). The Arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on any
                        basis other than an individual basis. The Arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue
                        any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis.</b> Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the

                        revocability or validity of the Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not
                        by an arbitrator. In any case in which (1) the dispute is filed as a class, collective, or representative action and (2)
                        there is a final judicial determination that all or part of the Class Action Waiver unenforceable, the class, collective,
                        and/or representative action to that extent must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion
                        of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration. While the Company will not take any
                        retaliatory action in response to any exercise of rights you may have under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act,
                        if any, the Company shall not be precluded from moving to enforce its rights under the FAA to compel arbitration on the
                        terms of service set forth in this Agreement.

                        <br>
                        <b>J.</b> Costs of Arbitration. Each party will pay the fees for his, her or its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to
                        which that party may later be entitled under applicable law (i.e., a party prevails on a claim that provides for the award
                        of reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party). In all cases where required by law, the Company will pay the Arbitrator's
                        and arbitration fees. If under applicable law the Company is not required to pay all of the Arbitrator’s and/or arbitration
                        fees, such fee(s) will be apportioned equally between the Parties or as otherwise required by applicable law. However, you
                        will not be required to bear any type of fee or expense that you would not be required to bear if you had filed the action
                        in a court of law. Any disputes in that regard will be resolved by the Arbitrator as soon as practicable after the
                        Arbitrator is selected, and Company shall bear all of the Arbitrator’s and arbitration fees until such time as the
                        Arbitrator resolves any such dispute.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>K.</b> Hearing and Award. The Parties will arbitrate their dispute before the Arbitrator, who shall confer with the
                        Parties regarding the conduct of the hearing and resolve any disputes the Parties may have in that regard. Within 30 days of
                        the close of the arbitration hearing, or within a longer period of time as agreed to by the Parties or as ordered by the
                        Arbitrator, any party will have the right to prepare, serve on the other party and file with the Arbitrator a brief.
                        The Arbitrator may award any party any remedy to which that party is entitled under applicable law, but such remedies shall
                        be limited to those that would be available to a party in his or her individual capacity in a court of law for the claims
                        presented to and decided by the Arbitrator, and no remedies that otherwise would be available to an individual in a court of
                        law will be forfeited by virtue of this Arbitration Provision. The Arbitrator will issue a decision or award in writing,
                        stating the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority
                        to enter a judgment upon the award made pursuant to the arbitration. The Arbitrator shall not have the power to commit
                        errors of law or legal reasoning, and the award may be vacated or corrected on appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction
                        for any such error.

                        For this reason, we have taken technical and organizational security measures that are commercially reasonable in order to
                        prevent loss, wrongful use, or unauthorized access to such data and information. For example, we may use firewalls and
                        Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption to ensure security of information and data in transit and in storage. At STUDENT
                        SUBLEASE we are committed to moving fast and responsibly if the security of your data is at risk and to inform you about

                        or over the phone. All of these functions are handled through the website and the Service. You should report to us
